# java-clock-app
A simple java clock app.

I really want to try to get a little coding in every day. My main focus this time was to try to figure out
how to seamlessly create a new project & git repository without accidentally creating a bunch of extra 
folders. Success! Navigating this helped me understand the how of git a little bit better. Woop woop!

I "followed" another tutorial to create this clock app. I say "followed" because this time, I created the app
while staying one step ahead of the tutorial, checking my work afterwards. It meant I had to go back and fix things 
like naming etc that didn't make sense as new parts were added, but it was fun to figure it out and get it working!
